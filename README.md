# Clustring of Individual household electric power consumption

This is the code for "Clustring Household Power Consumption" using K-Means. The data set is available at:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption

## Overview

In this code, we use K-Means clustering method to find patterns of electric energy onsumption of an individual household.

## Data Set Information

According to UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository:

"This archive contains 2075259 measurements gathered in a house located in Sceaux (7km of Paris, France) between December 2006 and November 2010 (47 months). 

Notes:
1.(global_active_power*1000/60 - sub_metering_1 - sub_metering_2 - sub_metering_3) represents the active energy consumed every minute (in watt hour) in the household by electrical equipment not measured in sub-meterings 1, 2 and 3. 
2.The dataset contains some missing values in the measurements (nearly 1,25% of the rows). All calendar timestamps are present in the dataset but for some timestamps, the measurement values are missing: a missing value is represented by the absence of value between two consecutive semi-colon attribute separators. For instance, the dataset shows missing values on April 28, 2007."
